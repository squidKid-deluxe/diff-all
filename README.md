# diff_all.py

diff_all.py is a simple script that uses `colordiff` to check for differences between files.  It can be very useful for comparing code in two different version folders.  To run, simply clone in the parent directory of the version folder and execute the script, using the command `python3 diff_all.py`.  The script will prompt you for two directory names, and then compare all of the compatible files file-by-file.
